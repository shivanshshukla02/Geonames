The API User Report system is a web-based application that provides a powerful and flexible way to analyze API request data. The system is designed to help users quickly and easily filter and visualize API request data based on specific criteria, such as a date range or a particular client.
The system's user interface is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The interface includes a form that allows users to select a date range and specific clients to include in the report. The form includes input fields for the start and end dates, as well as a multi-select dropdown for selecting clients. The interface also includes a reset button to clear all filters and start over.
Once the user has selected their filters, they can click the submit button to generate the report. The report includes two visualizations: a pie chart and a bar chart. The pie chart shows the distribution of API requests across the selected clients, while the bar chart shows the distribution of API requests across the selected date range. Both visualizations are created using Chart.js, a popular JavaScript library for creating charts and graphs.
The report also includes a paginated table that displays detailed information about each API request. The table includes columns for the log ID, the date and time the request was made, the client ID, the API query, and the result. The table is created using MDBDataTable, a React component that provides a responsive and customizable table interface.
In addition to the visualizations and table, the report includes an export button that allows users to download the report data in CSV format. The export feature is implemented using the Fetch API to make a request to the server to generate the CSV file.
Overall, the API User Report system provides a powerful and flexible way to analyze API request data. The system's user-friendly interface and interactive visualizations make it easy for users to quickly and easily filter and analyze their data, while the export feature allows them to share their findings with others. Whether you're a developer looking to analyze API request data for your application or a business analyst looking to understand usage patterns, the API User Report system is a valuable tool for anyone working with API request data.
